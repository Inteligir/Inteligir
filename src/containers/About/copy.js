  details: `
    <p>We started Learn with Friends with a simple goal: to live and learn vicariously through the experiences of our friends across the world. We have awesome friends scattered throughout the globe, all with different interests and pursuits. Like us, they’re learning exciting new things each and every day. We wanted to capture those learnings and share it with others.
    <p>Originally just a series of really long email threads between various small groups of 3-5 friends, Learn with Friends has grown into something much bigger.  While simple email chains initially validated the usefulness of the idea, it was severely limiting in terms of providing a platform for discussion of learnings. The latest iteration of Learn with Friends addresses many of the issues and provides a suite of new functionality. We hope you’re as excited to learn with friends as we are!
