    <p>We started Learn with Friends because lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Ex dolorum dolorem doloremque quam illum provident autem, accusantium necessitatibus sapiente soluta fugiat fuga deleniti amet, nulla nihil? Quam, consequuntur provident sit!
    <p>Although we started with the typical Silicon Valley model (get big fast and don’t worry about the revenue), we couldn’t shake the nagging feeling that we weren’t a business if we weren’t making money. We agreed with our investors that it was time to find a business model.
    <p>After a pilot with paid closed playlists we discovered that companies were willing to pay for Gibbon if we gave them the opportunity to create their own closed learning environment. An environment where employees could learn from each other.
    <p>While first targeting small businesses, we soon discovered the product market fit was with big enterprises. Yay for finding product-market fit! However, this meant we had to go from a product focused consumer company to a sales driven B2B company. A challenge for product focused people like ourselves.
